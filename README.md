# Product Analytics & Experimentation Project

## Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end product analytics and experimentation workflow, covering event modeling in PostgreSQL, SQL-based metric definition, A/B test evaluation in Python, and product decision-making.

The goal is to replicate how product analytics and data science are applied in a real environment, from raw event data to a business recommendation.


## Business Question

Does a redesigned onboarding flow improve early user retention in a SaaS product?


## Key Result

The onboarding variant increased 7-day retention by +1.7 percentage points, but the result did not reach statistical significance at the 95% confidence level, suggesting that the experiment may be underpowered.


## What This Project Demonstrates

- Event-based data modeling in PostgreSQL  
- SQL transformations and metric definitions  
- Retention analysis using cohort logic  
- A/B test design and statistical validation  
- Translation of analytical results into a product decision memo  


## Tech Stack

- **PostgreSQL** — event modeling and analytics queries  
- **SQL** — retention metric definition  
- **Python** — data analysis and experimentation  
  - pandas  
  - statsmodels  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** — reproducible analysis

## Limitations

- Syntatically generated data
- The results are not statistically sagnificant
